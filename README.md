# Stroke-Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of stroke in individuals based on their demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators. By identifying high-risk individuals, preventive measures can be implemented to reduce the incidence of stroke.

Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized patient records, including demographic details, medical history, lifestyle habits, and stroke outcomes. Each record is labeled with the presence or absence of stroke.

Prediction Model
Employed machine learning algorithm, support vector machines, to build a predictive model. This model leverages a combination of demographic, clinical, and lifestyle features to estimate the likelihood of stroke.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, imputing missing values, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Train the prediction model using the preprocessed dataset.
Prediction: Input new patient information into the model to obtain the probability of stroke occurrence.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
